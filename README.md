This repository provides a web site template for communities in need of a free, easy-to-configure online archive.

The `_config.yml` file contains settings for community-info, font, and color choices that affect the entire web site.

Each item in the collection has an item ID (community assigned, no spaces or punctuation) has one or more files associated with it (e.g. `0001.md`, in the following places:

- The `_items` folder contains one `.md` file for each item in the community-archive collection. These "markdown" files contain information in text form that the community-archive template uses to build a web page for each individual item, drawing in photos and transcripts from the other two file locations.
- The `/assets/items/` folder contains images named for each item (e.g. `0001_01.jpg` and `0001_02.jpg` would display 2 photos for item 0001)
